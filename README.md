## IR Sensor Arduino
This is a basic demonstration of toggling LED Lights controlled by a Samsung TV Remove using IR Sensor and Arduino UNO.

#### HOW IT WORKS?
Initially when the program starts, the red LED light is turned on, when the power button is pressed on the remote, it toggles between the green and red LED lights.
